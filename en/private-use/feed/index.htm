					<description><![CDATA[<p>The Next 620 is an excellently constructed <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-benefits-of-aluminum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aluminum</a> sloop with very pleasant handling. "Who can not sail in The Next, can not sail in anything", said well-known water sports journalist Epco Ongering about the boat. The aluminum boat is 6.20 m long and 2.12 m wide. The draft is 0.57m and the headroom is 1.15m. The hull weight is 650kg and the <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/design-categories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design category</a> is D. See also the little sisters <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/sloops/the-next-e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Next 530</a> and <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/sloops/the-next-outboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Next Outboard.</a></p>
<p>The Next offers plenty of space making it the ideal boat for a family, rental or group of friends. Thanks to its sturdy aluminum construction, The Next is hufterproof. The thick bumper ensures that you do not have to worry about a scratch. This comfortable aluminum boat is - like all other boats from Alumax - low maintenance and self-draining. All Alumax boats have self-draining valves in the skin so that water easily runs out of the boat. Very handy for cleaning the boat! The Next is available with or without an <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/particulieren/the-next-outboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outboard</a> motor.</p>
<h4>Why electric?</h4>
<p>The choice for a durable electric motor is one <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/ultimate-joy-with-an-electric-boat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for the future</a>. In some areas you are now only allowed to sail electrically, which is why we offer most models electrically. The advantages of electric boating are that it is<a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/how-to-clean-an-aluminum-boat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> easier to maintain</a>, quieter and for rental permits it is usually a must.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Bullit 600 E is an <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-benefits-of-aluminum/">aluminum lightweight</a> boat of 2.15m wide and 6.00m long. The Bullit 600 has a draft of 0.40m and a headroom of 1.15m. The hull weight is 600kg. The lightweight aluminum tender also has a remarkably shallow draft and is characterized by excellent sailing characteristics, stability and style. An advantage of aluminum boats is that they are low-maintenance, they can remain in the water during the winter and if necessary they can freeze. Above all, aluminum is vandal-proof, as it cannot be broken. This makes our boats resistant to vandalism. The Bullit 600 is multifunctional, which is why this indestructible aluminum boat - with the necessary modifications - is also used as a work boat. Think of inspection, fire fighting, patrol or enforcement boats.</strong></p>

<h4>Why outboard?</h4>
<p>Unlike an inboard engine, the investment in an <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-outboard-engine/">outboard engine</a> is lower compared to the number of horsepower. Please note: if a boat goes faster than 20 km per hour, there is a license requirement. The Bullit 720 outboard offers luxury, convenience and sufficient speed to experience water pleasure in various forms. The Bullit 720 outboard is also very suitable for water sports.</p>
<h4>Are you Bullit proof?</h4>
<p>The Bullit range consists of 6 indestructible, self-bailing and maintenance-free <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/private-use/tenders-en/">tenders</a>. The aluminium boats are designed and built at our yard in Meppel and promote carefree boating pleasure. Available with<a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-inboard-engine/"> inboard diesel engine,</a> <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-outboard-engine/">outboard petrol engine</a> or an <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-electric-drive/">electric motor.</a> Because aluminium is much lighter than for example a comparable polyester sloop, they can also sail much faster. The Bullit series is designed for these speeds. They remain flat and above all stable sailing, so you do not have to stand up. Moreover, they are easy to trailer. Are you ready to cast off?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Bullit 720 outboard is an aluminum lightweight boat of 2.3 m wide and 7.20 m long. The draft of the boat is 0.50m and the vertical clearance 1.25m. The hull weight of the Bullit 720 is 980 kilograms. The lightweight aluminium tender also has a remarkably shallow draught and is characterised by excellent sailing characteristics, stability and many possibilities due to space. An advantage of aluminium boats is that they are low-maintenance, they can be left in the water during the winter and if necessary they can freeze. Above all, aluminium is vandal-proof, it cannot be broken. This makes our boats resistant to vandalism. The Bullit 720 is multifunctional, which is why this aluminium boat is also used as a work boat with various extras for the desired purpose.</strong></p>
