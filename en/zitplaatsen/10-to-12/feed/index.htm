					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Hydrogen as an energy carrier can play a major role in the energy transition. However, its commercial application is still in the start-up phase. The investment costs of the drive system are still so high that profitable operation is not feasible. And then there is also the chicken-or-egg problem for the tank infrastructure: as long as there are no hydrogen vessels, the tank infrastructure will remain limited and vice versa. This problem is now being solved at the Alumax Boats yard. This is where the first hydrogen water taxi is being built for Watertaxi Rotterdam. In this aluminum water taxi, hydrogen is used to generate electricity to power the boat, making the range comparable to that of a diesel-powered ship.</strong><br />
The hydrogen Watertaxi Rotterdam is being developed by the SWIM consortium, with financial support from the Municipality of Rotterdam, the Ministry of Infrastructure, the Gieskes-Strijdbis fund and Innovation Quarter.</p>
<p>The SWIM consortium consists of Flying Fish, Zepp.solutions, Enviu and Watertaxi Rotterdam. In this collaboration, Zepp.solutions is responsible for the maritime hydrogen system, Watertaxi Rotterdam is responsible for the exploitation of the hydrogen Watertaxi and Enviu is the initiator, project leader and venture builder. <a href="https://www.flying-fish.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flying Fish</a> has developed the innovative E-Drive system. The SWIM consortium has developed this innovative hydrogen-electric powertrain to accelerate the energy transition on water and give customers the opportunity to switch to a sustainable fuel without making operational concessions.</p>
<p>At the Alumax Boats yard, Alumax technicians are currently working closely with Flying Fish engineers.</p>
<p>For this E-drive, Flying Fish and their team of engineers have developed and built the high voltage distribution and safety system that distributes the power between the fuel cell system, the high voltage battery, the AC/DC charger, the DC/DC converter and the motor. In addition, the temperature management system, which cools all high-voltage components, was built by the people of Delft. But the low-voltage power and control system, including the Vessel Control Unit (VCU), the electrical switchboard and the power distribution to the powertrain components, was also designed by Flying Fish.</p>
<p><em>The next phase of construction will be the incorporation of the hydrogen fuel cell system. The maritime hydrogen system, developed by zepp.solutions, is a 45 kW all-in-1 module that contains all components necessary to generate electrical energy from hydrogen. In addition to the development and production of this module, zepp.solutions is also responsible for hydrogen storage. Divided over several tanks, the ship will soon be able to carry 14 kg of hydrogen, enough to sail around Rotterdam for a full day (about 9 hours).</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Bullit 720 outboard is an aluminium lightweight <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/what-is-a-tender-boat/">tender boat</a> of 2.3m wide and 7.20m long. The draft of the boat is 0.50m and the vertical clearance 1.25m. The hull weight of the Bullit 720 is 980 kilograms and the <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/design-categories/">design category</a> is C.</strong></p>
<p>The light aluminium tender is characterised by excellent sailing characteristics, stability and many possibilities due to space. <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-benefits-of-aluminum/">An advantage of aluminium boats</a> is that they are low-maintenance, they can be left in the water during the winter and if necessary they can freeze. Above all, aluminium is vandal-proof, it cannot be broken. This makes our boats resistant to vandalism. The Bullit 720 is multifunctional, that is why this aluminium boat is also used as a <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/multifunctional-aluminum-boats/">work boat</a> with various extras for the desired application. All Alumax boats have self-draining valves in the hull so that water can easily drain out of the boat. Very easy for <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/how-to-clean-an-aluminum-boat/">cleaning the boat!</a></p>
<h4>Why outboard?</h4>
<p>Unlike an inboard engine, the investment in an <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-outboard-engine/">outboard engine</a> is lower compared to the number of horsepower. Please note: if a boat goes faster than 20 km per hour, there is a license requirement. The Bullit 720 outboard offers luxury, convenience and sufficient speed to experience water pleasure in various forms. The Bullit 720 outboard is also very suitable for water sports.</p>
<h4>Are you Bullit proof?</h4>
<p>The Bullit range consists of 6 indestructible, self-bailing and maintenance-free <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/private-use/tenders-en/">tenders</a>. The aluminium boats are designed and built at our yard in Meppel and promote carefree boating pleasure. Available with<a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-inboard-engine/"> inboard diesel engine,</a> <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-outboard-engine/">outboard petrol engine</a> or an <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-electric-drive/">electric motor.</a> Because aluminium is much lighter than for example a comparable polyester sloop, they can also sail much faster. The Bullit series is designed for these speeds. They remain flat and above all stable sailing, so you do not have to stand up. Moreover, they are easy to trailer. Are you ready to cast off?</p>
