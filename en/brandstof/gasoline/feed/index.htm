					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Bullit 720 outboard is an aluminium lightweight <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/what-is-a-tender-boat/">tender boat</a> of 2.3m wide and 7.20m long. The draft of the boat is 0.50m and the vertical clearance 1.25m. The hull weight of the Bullit 720 is 980 kilograms and the <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/design-categories/">design category</a> is C.</strong></p>
<p>The light aluminium tender is characterised by excellent sailing characteristics, stability and many possibilities due to space. <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-benefits-of-aluminum/">An advantage of aluminium boats</a> is that they are low-maintenance, they can be left in the water during the winter and if necessary they can freeze. Above all, aluminium is vandal-proof, it cannot be broken. This makes our boats resistant to vandalism. The Bullit 720 is multifunctional, that is why this aluminium boat is also used as a <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/multifunctional-aluminum-boats/">work boat</a> with various extras for the desired application. All Alumax boats have self-draining valves in the hull so that water can easily drain out of the boat. Very easy for <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/how-to-clean-an-aluminum-boat/">cleaning the boat!</a></p>
<h4>Why outboard?</h4>
<p>Unlike an inboard engine, the investment in an <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-outboard-engine/">outboard engine</a> is lower compared to the number of horsepower. Please note: if a boat goes faster than 20 km per hour, there is a license requirement. The Bullit 720 outboard offers luxury, convenience and sufficient speed to experience water pleasure in various forms. The Bullit 720 outboard is also very suitable for water sports.</p>
<h4>Are you Bullit proof?</h4>
<p>The Bullit range consists of 6 indestructible, self-bailing and maintenance-free <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/private-use/tenders-en/">tenders</a>. The aluminium boats are designed and built at our yard in Meppel and promote carefree boating pleasure. Available with<a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-inboard-engine/"> inboard diesel engine,</a> <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-outboard-engine/">outboard petrol engine</a> or an <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-electric-drive/">electric motor.</a> Because aluminium is much lighter than for example a comparable polyester sloop, they can also sail much faster. The Bullit series is designed for these speeds. They remain flat and above all stable sailing, so you do not have to stand up. Moreover, they are easy to trailer. Are you ready to cast off?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The workboat 660 is based on the <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/tenders-en/bullit-660-outboard/">Bullit 660</a>, partly because it has excellent sailing properties and is reliable. Because aluminium is easily adaptable, this boat can be equipped according to your wishes. The tender boat is 6.60 m long and 2.46 m wide. The draft is 0.60m and the vertical clearance 1.12m. The hull weight is 880kg.</strong></p>
<p>The boat can not only be used as a fire boat - as in the video - but also as an inspection boat, enforcement boat, goods transport, passenger transport and patrol boat. You can't really think of it that way...<br />
The photos show the radar bracket, but it is also available with a t-top or full cabin.<br />
<em>Let us know your wishes and let's make a nice boat together!</em></p>
