					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Worker 650 was developed in collaboration with BAM International for a project in Sierra Leone. Due to the versatility and the strong basis of the aluminum workboat, the Worker 650 can be used for various purposes.</strong></p>
<p>This extremely strong, maintenance-free work boat is already sailing for various customers as survey boat, patrol boat, fire boat, surveillance boat and police boat. The V-bottom underwater hull ensures, among other things, good sailing properties and prevents spray water. Also, the workboats 650 and 750 are easy to trailer and the weight including trailer remains under 3500kg.</p>
<p>As standard, this workboat is equipped with a 57 HP (4JH57) Yanmar<a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-inboard-engine/"> inboard diesel engine</a>, but <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-outboard-engine/">gasoline</a> or diesel outboard is also possible. In addition, the workboats are all equipped with a self-draining cockpit floor, solid push bow or fender in front of the bow.

					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The workboat 660 is based on the <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/tenders-en/bullit-660-outboard/">Bullit 660</a>, partly because it has excellent sailing properties and is reliable. Because aluminium is easily adaptable, this boat can be equipped according to your wishes. The tender boat is 6.60 m long and 2.46 m wide. The draft is 0.60m and the vertical clearance 1.12m. The hull weight is 880kg.</strong></p>
<p>The boat can not only be used as a fire boat - as in the video - but also as an inspection boat, enforcement boat, goods transport, passenger transport and patrol boat. You can't really think of it that way...<br />
The photos show the radar bracket, but it is also available with a t-top or full cabin.<br />
<em>Let us know your wishes and let's make a nice boat together!</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>This tender boat based on the well-known <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/tenders-en/bullit-600-outboard/">Bullit 600</a>. The aluminum boat is 6.00m long and 2.15m wide. The draft is 0.40m and the vertical clearance 1.12m. The hull weight is 600kg.</p>
<p>A large number of fire brigades use a boat made by Alumax Boats. The freedom from maintenance, robustness and excellent sailing characteristics make the fire boat very suitable for professional use. Also the unlimited possibilities to expand with a fire extinguisher, navigation equipment, telephony, etc, make many fire brigades choose the Bullit 600.</p>
