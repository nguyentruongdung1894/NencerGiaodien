					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Bullit 600 inboard is an<a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-benefits-of-aluminum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> aluminum</a> lightweight boat and offers boating fun for the whole family. The tender boat is 6.00m long and 2.15m wide. The draft is 0.40m and the headroom 1.12m. The hull weight is 621kg and the<a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/design-categories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> design category</a> is C.</strong></p>
<p>The lightweight aluminum tender is characterized by excellent sailing characteristics, stability and space. An advantage of aluminum boats is that they are low maintenance, they can remain in the water in winter and freeze if necessary. Above all, aluminum is foolproof, because it is not broken. This makes our boats resistant to vandalism. The Bullit 600 is multifunctional, which is why this indestructible aluminum boat - with the necessary modifications - is also used as a <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/workboats/workboat-600/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work boat</a>. Think of fireboats, patrol boats or enforcement boats.</p>
<p>All Alumax boats have self-draining valves in the hull so that water can easily drain out of the boat. Very handy for <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/how-to-clean-an-aluminum-boat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cleaning the boat</a>!</p>
<h4>Why inboard?</h4>
<p>In contrast to an outboard engine, the inboard engine is - as the name suggests - integrated in the boat. This is an advantage because boat and engine are one and are also seen as such. Another advantage is that vandalism has a smaller chance of succeeding. An inboard engine is more economical in fuel consumption, you can sail all day for just a few liters. The Bullit 660 inboard offers comfort, convenience and enough safety to sail on canals and turbulent waters. <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/de-voordelen-van-een-binnenboord-motor-inboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more</a> benefits of an inboard engine here.</p>
<h4>Are you Bullit proof?</h4>
<p>The Bullit series consists of 6 indestructible, self-draining and maintenance-free tenders. The aluminum boats are designed and built at our yard in Meppel and promote carefree boating pleasure. Available with inboard diesel engine, <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-outboard-engine/">outboard</a> gasoline engine or an <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-electric-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electric motor</a>. Please note: if a boat goes faster than 20 km per hour, a boating <a href="https://www.cbr.nl/nl/recreatievaart-en-privevliegers/recreatievaart/recreatievaart-2/vaarbewijsplicht.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">license is required</a>.   Because aluminum is much lighter than, for example, a comparable polyester sloop, they can also sail much faster. The Bullit series is designed to handle these speeds. They remain flat and above all stable sailing, so you do not have to stand. Moreover, they are easy to trailer. Are you going to cast off the ropes?</p>
