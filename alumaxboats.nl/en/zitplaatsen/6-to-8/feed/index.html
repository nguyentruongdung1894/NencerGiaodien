					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Bullit 600 E is an <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-benefits-of-aluminum/">aluminum lightweight</a> boat of 2.15m wide and 6.00m long. The Bullit 600 has a draft of 0.40m and a headroom of 1.15m. The hull weight is 600kg. The lightweight aluminum tender also has a remarkably shallow draft and is characterized by excellent sailing characteristics, stability and style. An advantage of aluminum boats is that they are low-maintenance, they can remain in the water during the winter and if necessary they can freeze. Above all, aluminum is vandal-proof, as it cannot be broken. This makes our boats resistant to vandalism. The Bullit 600 is multifunctional, which is why this indestructible aluminum boat - with the necessary modifications - is also used as a work boat. Think of inspection, fire fighting, patrol or enforcement boats.</strong></p>
<h4>Why electric?</h4>
<p>The choice for a durable electric motor is one<a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/ultimate-joy-with-an-electric-boat/"> for the future.</a> In some areas, you are now only allowed to sail electrically, which is why we offer most models electrically. The advantages of electric boating are, among other things, that it is more <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/taking-care-of-batteries/">maintenance-friendly,</a> quieter and it is usually a must for rental licences.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Next is an excellently constructed <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-benefits-of-aluminum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aluminum</a> sloop with very pleasant sailing behavior. "Who can not sail in The Next, can not sail in anything", said well-known water sports journalist Epco Ongering about the boat. The boat is 5.30 m long and 2.00 m wide. The draft is 0.45m and the headroom is 1.07m. The hull weight is 400kg and the<a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/design-categories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> design category</a> is D.</strong></p>
<p>Despite its dimensions, The Next offers a surprising amount of space, making it the ideal boat for a family, rental or group of friends. Thanks to its solid aluminum construction, The Next is hufterproof. The thick bumper ensures that you do not have to worry about a scratch. This comfortable aluminum boat is - like all other Alumax boats - low maintenance and self-draining. The Next is available as an<a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-electric-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> electric</a> sloop or with an <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-outboard-engine/">outboard motor</a>. All Alumax boats have self-draining devices in the skin, making it easy for water to drain out of the boat.

<h4>Why outboard?</h4>
<p>Unlike an inboard engine, the investment in an outboard engine is lower compared to the number of HP. Note: if a boat goes faster than 20 km per hour there is a <a href="https://www.cbr.nl/nl/recreatievaart-en-privevliegers/recreatievaart/recreatievaart-2/vaarbewijsplicht.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">license requirement</a>. The Bullit 660 outboard offers comfort, convenience and sufficient speed to experience water fun in various forms. The Bullit 660 outboard is also ideal for water sports.</p>
<h4>Are you Bullit proof?</h4>
<p>The Bullit series consists of 6 indestructible, self-draining and maintenance-free <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/private-use/tenders-en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tenders</a>. The aluminum boats are designed and built at our yard in Meppel and promote carefree boating pleasure.

Because aluminum is much lighter than for example a comparable polyester sloop, they can also sail much faster. The Bullit series is designed for these speeds. They remain flat and above all stable sailing, so you do not have to stand. Moreover, they are easy to trailer. Are you going to cast off the ropes?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Bullit 660 outboard is an<a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-benefits-of-aluminum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> aluminum</a> lightweight boat and offers boating fun for the whole family. The tender boat is 6.60m long and 2.46m wide. The draft is 0.60m and the headroom 1.12m. The hull weight is 880kg and the <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/design-categories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design category</a> is C.</strong></p>
<p>The lightweight aluminum tender is characterized by excellent sailing characteristics, stability and space. An advantage of aluminum boats is that they are low maintenance, they can remain in the water during the winter and freeze if necessary. Above all, aluminum is foolproof, because it is not broken. This makes our boats resistant to vandalism. The Bullit 660 is multifunctional, therefore this aluminum boat is also used as a <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/aluminum-tender-boats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">workboat</a> with various extras for the desired use.</p>
<p>All Alumax boats have self-draining valves in the hull so that water can easily drain out of the boat. Very handy for <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/how-to-clean-an-aluminum-boat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cleaning the boat</a>!</p>
<h4>Why outboard?</h4>
<p>Unlike an inboard engine, the investment in an outboard engine is lower compared to the number of HP. Note: if a boat goes faster than 20 km per hour there is a <a href="https://www.cbr.nl/nl/recreatievaart-en-privevliegers/recreatievaart/recreatievaart-2/vaarbewijsplicht.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">license requirement</a>. The Bullit 660 outboard offers comfort, convenience and sufficient speed to experience water fun in various forms. The Bullit 660 outboard is also ideal for water sports.</p>
<h4>Are you Bullit proof?</h4>
<p>The Bullit series consists of 6 indestructible, self-draining and maintenance-free <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/what-is-a-tender-boat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tenders</a>. The aluminum boats are designed and built at our yard in Meppel and promote carefree boating pleasure. Available with <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-inboard-engine/">inboard</a> diesel engine, outboard gasoline engine or an<a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-electric-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> electric motor</a>. Because aluminum is much lighter than for example a comparable polyester sloop, they can also sail much faster. The Bullit series is designed for these speeds. They remain flat and above all stable sailing, so you do not have to stand. Moreover, they are easy to trailer. Are you going to cast off the ropes?</p>
