					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Worker 650 was developed in collaboration with BAM International for a project in Sierra Leone. Due to the versatility and the strong basis of the aluminum workboat, the Worker 650 can be used for various purposes.</strong></p>
<p>This extremely strong, maintenance-free work boat is already sailing for various customers as survey boat, patrol boat, fire boat, surveillance boat and police boat. The V-bottom underwater hull ensures, among other things, good sailing properties and prevents spray water.

					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The aluminum fishing trawler you see in the pictures was designed together with the Dutch family mr Harm and Bote Teerling. Its shallow draught and flat bottom make it easier to reach the plots without the boat falling dry and lying on "an ear".</strong></p>
<p>The hydraulic crane can continue to operate at all times - even when there is no more water - because the bottom is flat with propellers and rudders in tunnels and cooling tubes on the surface with wear strips. In addition, the Teerling hand cockle fisherman's boat is equipped with two 180hp Volvo-Penta grease-lubricated propeller shaft systems.</p>
<p>It is possible to carry 20 tonnes of cargo in the lowered hold under the deck. There is also room for 6 people with bedrooms, shower, toilet and wheelhouse equipped with underfloor heating.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>This series - extremely suitable for fuel-efficient passenger transport - is standard equipped with, among other things, air pressure-suspended driver's seat, windscreen wipers, heating, air pressure-controlled doors and roof hatch, and rear doors that close or open the "balcony". Watertaxi 10 is propelled by 410 HP Cummins diesel (QSL9) engine in combination with a Hamilton 292 HJ Waterjet. In addition to proper propulsion, safety, ease of use and reliability were central to the design of these aluminum boats. Therefore, the water cabs are among other things, 1-handed steerable. Even the windows remain intact during high speeds and point loads. Want to know how? We are happy to tell you!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The aluminum workboat Worker 33 originated from a wish of the Scheveningen Port Authority. The main task of the indestructible workboat was to be able to remove floating objects from the water under one-man steering. By making outside steering possible, the skipper can take over completely outside the wheelhouse and take position next to the floating object. The workboat is 10m long and 3.30m wide. The draft is 0.75m and the headroom 2.60. The hull weight is 3500kg.</p>
<h4>Maintenance, inspection and measurement of the steel sheet piling in the harbor.</h4>
<p>To check the cathodic protection layer on the sheet piling, a special bow was designed for the aluminum workboat. This fits exactly against the sheet piling and under its concrete beam, the ladder on the foredeck makes it possible to carry out the measurement from the water in a health and safety manner.<br />
In short, whatever your wishes are.... Our aluminum workboats can be obtained completely according to your wishes.</p>
<h4>Propulsion</h4>
<p>The Worker 33 is a sustainable boat thanks to the use of aluminium and its low emissions. The Yanmar 170PK (4LV170) common rail diesel engine is the first to be used in the Netherlands. The combination of a 15KW Krautler Hybrid drive and a multi belt transmission on the main engine shaft allows the boat to go electric for a full day with the same steering system. Within one night the battery is fully charged again. There are fewer vulnerable parts placed underwater by this hybrid solution. By using one rudder and one rudder, maintenance is also reduced to a minimum.</p>
<p>In addition to the above equipment the Worker 33 was chosen to include a toilet, kitchen with hot and cold water, storage space, 6 seats, navigation equipment including radar, large self-draining cockpit and outside steering.</p>
<p><strong><em>What do you need to use a Worker 33 to your liking?</em></strong></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The workboat 660 is based on the <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/tenders-en/bullit-660-outboard/">Bullit 660</a>, partly because it has excellent sailing properties and is reliable. Because aluminium is easily adaptable, this boat can be equipped according to your wishes. The tender boat is 6.60 m long and 2.46 m wide. The draft is 0.60m and the vertical clearance 1.12m. The hull weight is 880kg.</strong></p>
<p>The boat can not only be used as a fire boat - as in the video - but also as an inspection boat, enforcement boat, goods transport, passenger transport and patrol boat. You can't really think of it that way...<br />
The photos show the radar bracket, but it is also available with a t-top or full cabin.<br />
<em>Let us know your wishes and let's make a nice boat together!</em></p>
