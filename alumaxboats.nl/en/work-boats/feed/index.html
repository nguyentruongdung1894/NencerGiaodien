					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Hydrogen as an energy carrier can play a major role in the energy transition. However, its commercial application is still in the start-up phase. The investment costs of the drive system are still so high that profitable operation is not feasible. And then there is also the chicken-or-egg problem for the tank infrastructure: as long as there are no hydrogen vessels, the tank infrastructure will remain limited and vice versa. This problem is now being solved at the Alumax Boats yard. This is where the first hydrogen water taxi is being built for Watertaxi Rotterdam. In this aluminum water taxi, hydrogen is used to generate electricity to power the boat, making the range comparable to that of a diesel-powered ship.</strong><br />
The hydrogen Watertaxi Rotterdam is being developed by the SWIM consortium, with financial support from the Municipality of Rotterdam, the Ministry of Infrastructure, the Gieskes-Strijdbis fund and Innovation Quarter.</p>
<p>The SWIM consortium consists of Flying Fish, Zepp.solutions, Enviu and Watertaxi Rotterdam. In this collaboration, Zepp.solutions is responsible for the maritime hydrogen system, Watertaxi Rotterdam is responsible for the exploitation of the hydrogen Watertaxi and Enviu is the initiator, project leader and venture builder. <a href="https://www.flying-fish.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flying Fish</a> has developed the innovative E-Drive system. The SWIM consortium has developed this innovative hydrogen-electric powertrain to accelerate the energy transition on water and give customers the opportunity to switch to a sustainable fuel without making operational concessions.</p>
<p>At the Alumax Boats yard, Alumax technicians are currently working closely with Flying Fish engineers.</p>
<p>For this E-drive, Flying Fish and their team of engineers have developed and built the high voltage distribution and safety system that distributes the power between the fuel cell system, the high voltage battery, the AC/DC charger, the DC/DC converter and the motor. In addition, the temperature management system, which cools all high-voltage components, was built by the people of Delft. But the low-voltage power and control system, including the Vessel Control Unit (VCU), the electrical switchboard and the power distribution to the powertrain components, was also designed by Flying Fish.</p>
<p><em>The next phase of construction will be the incorporation of the hydrogen fuel cell system. The maritime hydrogen system, developed by zepp.solutions, is a 45 kW all-in-1 module that contains all components necessary to generate electrical energy from hydrogen. In addition to the development and production of this module, zepp.solutions is also responsible for hydrogen storage. Divided over several tanks, the ship will soon be able to carry 14 kg of hydrogen, enough to sail around Rotterdam for a full day (about 9 hours).</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Worker 650 was developed in collaboration with BAM International for a project in Sierra Leone. Due to the versatility and the strong basis of the aluminum workboat, the Worker 650 can be used for various purposes.</strong></p>
<p>This extremely strong, maintenance-free work boat is already sailing for various customers as survey boat, patrol boat, fire boat, surveillance boat and police boat. The V-bottom underwater hull ensures, among other things, good sailing properties and prevents spray water. Also, the workboats 650 and 750 are easy to trailer and the weight including trailer remains under 3500kg.</p>
<p>As standard, this workboat is equipped with a 57 HP (4JH57) Yanmar<a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-inboard-engine/"> inboard diesel engine</a>, but <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-outboard-engine/">gasoline</a> or diesel outboard is also possible. In addition, the workboats are all equipped with a self-draining cockpit floor, solid push bow or fender in front of the bow. Furthermore, these almost indestructible and flame-retardant workboats can be equipped according to your wishes.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The aluminum fishing trawler you see in the pictures was designed together with the Dutch family mr Harm and Bote Teerling. Its shallow draught and flat bottom make it easier to reach the plots without the boat falling dry and lying on "an ear".</strong></p>
<p>The hydraulic crane can continue to operate at all times - even when there is no more water - because the bottom is flat with propellers and rudders in tunnels and cooling tubes on the surface with wear strips. In addition, the Teerling hand cockle fisherman's boat is equipped with two 180hp Volvo-Penta grease-lubricated propeller shaft systems.</p>
<p>It is possible to carry 20 tonnes of cargo in the lowered hold under the deck. There is also room for 6 people with bedrooms, shower, toilet and wheelhouse equipped with underfloor heating.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Watertaxi FL is an aluminum taxi boat of 12.17 m long and 3.15 m wide. The draft is 0.66m and the vertical clearance 2.74m. The hull weight is 4,000kg. What distinguishes the Watertaxi FL from the XL is that this aluminium boat can not only transport passengers, but also their bicycles or other goods. This water taxi model can transport a total of 12 people.</strong></p>
<p>Just like the Watertaxi 30 XL, the FL is completely emission-free and therefore offers the cleanest form of passenger transport over water. The taxi boat is equipped with two 20Kw - 96 volt water-cooled Bellmarine / Transfluid Drivemaster electric motors. Besides the environmental benefits, the water taxi is also silent and gives hardly any vibrations while sailing.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The aluminum workboat Worker 33 originated from a wish of the Scheveningen Port Authority. The main task of the indestructible workboat was to be able to remove floating objects from the water under one-man steering. By making outside steering possible, the skipper can take over completely outside the wheelhouse and take position next to the floating object. The workboat is 10m long and 3.30m wide. The draft is 0.75m and the headroom 2.60. The hull weight is 3500kg.</p>
<h4>Maintenance, inspection and measurement of the steel sheet piling in the harbor.</h4>
<p>To check the cathodic protection layer on the sheet piling, a special bow was designed for the aluminum workboat. This fits exactly against the sheet piling and under its concrete beam, the ladder on the foredeck makes it possible to carry out the measurement from the water in a health and safety manner.<br />
In short, whatever your wishes are.... Our aluminum workboats can be obtained completely according to your wishes.</p>
<h4>Propulsion</h4>
<p>The Worker 33 is a sustainable boat thanks to the use of aluminium and its low emissions. The Yanmar 170PK (4LV170) common rail diesel engine is the first to be used in the Netherlands. The combination of a 15KW Krautler Hybrid drive and a multi belt transmission on the main engine shaft allows the boat to go electric for a full day with the same steering system. Within one night the battery is fully charged again. There are fewer vulnerable parts placed underwater by this hybrid solution. By using one rudder and one rudder, maintenance is also reduced to a minimum.</p>
<p>In addition to the above equipment the Worker 33 was chosen to include a toilet, kitchen with hot and cold water, storage space, 6 seats, navigation equipment including radar, large self-draining cockpit and outside steering.</p>
