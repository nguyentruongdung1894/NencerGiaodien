					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Worker 650 was developed in collaboration with BAM International for a project in Sierra Leone. Due to the versatility and the strong basis of the aluminum workboat, the Worker 650 can be used for various purposes.</strong></p>
<p>This extremely strong, maintenance-free work boat is already sailing for various customers as survey boat, patrol boat, fire boat, surveillance boat and police boat. The V-bottom underwater hull ensures, among other things, good sailing properties and prevents spray water. Also, the workboats 650 and 750 are easy to trailer and the weight including trailer remains under 3500kg.</p>
<p>As standard, this workboat is equipped with a 57 HP (4JH57) Yanmar<a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-inboard-engine/"> inboard diesel engine</a>, but <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-outboard-engine/">gasoline</a> or diesel outboard is also possible. In addition, the workboats are all equipped with a self-draining cockpit floor, solid push bow or fender in front of the bow. Furthermore, these almost indestructible and flame-retardant workboats can be equipped according to your wishes.</p>
