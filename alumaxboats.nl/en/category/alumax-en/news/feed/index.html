				<h1>Alumax Boats welcomes King during forward-looking working visit to Port of Zwolle</h1>
<em>Date: 4 January 2023</em>

Meppel, The Netherlands &#8211; On Wednesday afternoon 17th of January, Alumax Boats will be in the spotlight when His Majesty the King pays a promising working visit to Port of Zwolle in Meppel. As a leading player in the maritime industry, Alumax Boats is looking forward to this opportunity to take the lead in circular entrepreneurship, economic development and administrative cooperation.
<h3>Exclusive tour of Alumax Boats shipyard</h3>
The highlight of the working visit will be the tour at Alumax Boats, where His Majesty will be given an exclusive tour of the shipyard. Our experienced staff will be happy to share their expertise on the design and construction process of our aluminium boats, including sloops, water taxis and electric tour boats. Port Meppel will serve as a dynamic backdrop for this showcase of craftsmanship and innovation.
<h3>Inspiring insights into circular entrepreneurship</h3>
Following this, the owner of Weever Groep will talk about initiatives in the port around hydrogen, about circular construction and about reusing the materials generated by the demolition of buildings and cargo ships. The King will then be joined by two trucks from truck company Scania to explain the company&#8217;s role at Port of Zwolle and the development of hydrogen-powered trucks.
<h3>Port of Zwolle: leading hub for circular businesses</h3>
Another highlight of the visit is the water taxi experience, provided by Alumax Boats, on which His Majesty will sail to the Fieldlab Circular Entrepreneurship. Here, entrepreneurs and students are jointly committed to developing, testing and producing new (food) products with a circular approach.
<h3>Another highlight</h3>
Port of Zwolle is actively committed as a logistics hub for circular activity, in line with the energy transition, the growth of waterborne transport and circular production processes. Together with entrepreneurs, the region and educational institutions, Port of Zwolle is working on sustainability, digitalisation and future-proof port facilities.
<h3>A special day ahead</h3>
Alumax Boats is looking forward to this special day when we can share our vision of a sustainable and circular future together with His Majesty the King.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remko Germeraad is looking beyond aluminum boats. The expansion of Alumax Boats is a step into the future, but Germeraad (46) is looking beyond the square meters of his twenty-year-old company.</p>
<p>The step had to be taken, Gemeraad says. The 750 square meters in the building on the industrial estate between the Setheweg and the N375 were previously limiting for Alumax Boats, designer and builder of aluminum boats. &#8220;With the building added, our production capacity has doubled&#8221;, Germeraad calculates.</p>
<p>And &#8220;so&#8221; Alumax is destined to grow, Remko confirms. Orders and commissions abound. From Delft and Amsterdam, but also from Vietnam and Paraguay.</p>
<p>The new building was owned by Thecla Bodewes Shipyards, but was not in use for a long time. The additional hall is 900 square meters in size and is located a little further away, on the Zomerdijk, on the border of Drenthe and Overijssel. &#8220;And by the water&#8221;, Germeraad adds well.</p>
<p>That addition is not insignificant for a water-bound business. &#8220;A car garage does not stand in a meadow with a dirt road leading to it either&#8221;, Germeraad compares. &#8220;We need water, for example, to test our products. For boats larger than eight meters, we now need special transport by road.&#8221;</p>
<p>The issue is a sticking point in the political discussion surrounding the Meppel harbor: should it be bigger, and if so, how? With the widening of the lock at Kornwerderzand, Meppel beach will be accessible to larger sea-going vessels and will have a larger hinterland, giving world ports like Rotterdam and Antwerp more room to specialize. But land is scarce in the port area around Meppel, where there is demand from entrpreneurs for as much as 37 hectares, but barely a postage stamp of space. From his title as Port Entrepreneur of the Year (2016), Germeraad interjected into the discussion when asked. &#8220;Why not make the waterfront lots smaller, so you get 10 smaller entrepreneurs instead of two large ones? The municipality should focus more on smaller businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>And furthermore, he continued, available land should be looked at better. While politicians make the choice: infill on existing land or expand to Oever S (Staphorst), Germeraad wants to literally move the area. &#8220;Why look at Staphorst land? There is still enough waterfront space in Meppel that is not being used. Look at North IV. And also think about creating more space by making an inlet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pedal boats</p>
<p>And while he is at it with his ideas for the future, Germeraad would also like to shine his light on sand extraction site Bremenbergplas, on the other side of the N375. He envisions an open conncetion with Meppel on the one hand and Wanneperveen and Giethoorn on the other. &#8220;Why not make an electric water ski track there? A recreational lake, with pavilion, pedel boat rental, a trailer ramp so people can take their boats towards Wanneperveen and Giethoorn. No need for such a theme park. You already have it. Meppel has enormous amounts of water, but does nothing with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>All these ideas, plans, Germeraad does not want to keep them to himself. &#8220;I am not only an entrepreneur. I am not tied to Meppel &#8211; we have already looked at expansion in Zwolle and Steenwijk &#8211; but I do have staff and customers from Meppel. So I look beyond the square meters we&#8217;re sitting on.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, Alumax is in the process of establishing a business in Vietnam, but Germeraad is careful not to get ahead of himself in the drive to get bigger. &#8220;We now have to make sure, after the extra corporate hall, hat we keep control, rest. You can&#8217;t build a skyscraper on the foundation of a single-family home. We have to be able to keep up with ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hydraulic roof</p>
<p>Alumax&#8217;s productions sail in cities such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Leiden and Delft. For Delft, the Meppel company is currently producing two water busses that transport passengers by water through the center of the city. There was only one prblem: the boat did not fit under the bridge. &#8220;Now we have hydraulically lowered the roof,&#8221; says Germeraad.</p>
<p>The movable roof is the outcome of the issue of weight and energy. In the same inventive way, Alumax recently came up with removable protection for propeller engines for fireboats. &#8220;Pioneering and seeing opportunities&#8221;, Germeraad sums up the entrepreneurship of Alumax &#8211; which he does together with his associate Jarno Visscher.</p>
<p>Sixteen years ago, a customer asked for an aluminum boat with electric steering; it was unique at that time. &#8220;But I did think: I think it should be possible,&#8221; Germeraad looks back.</p>
<p>In a world in search of sustainability and circularity, sustainable and clean waterborne transportation has gained all the momentum in recent years. Alumax is riding those waves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Alumax Boats has designed a new aluminum model in the passenger transport line. The Alumax Waterbus Fifty is fifteen meters long, fully electric and can accommodate fifty passengers. The first two Waterbus Fifty boats will serve as a means of public transport in the historic city of Delft from the summer of 2023. The Delft aluminum boats will have a hydraulic roof so that they can sail under a number of low bridges. Alumax Boats CEO Remko Germeraad is very pleased with the Alumax Waterbus Fifty. “This new model is a valuable addition to our line of passenger transport models.”</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Delft gets the scoop<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>The Waterbus Fifty will serve as public transport in Delft, under the name Waterbus Delft, from Delft Station. Along the way it makes a considerable number of stops, connecting various knowledge and cultural institutions, companies and neighborhoods in Delft in a sustainable way. Mobility alderman of Delft Martina Huijsmans is pleased with the arrival of the Waterbus in Delft. “Innovations like these contribute to a wide range of sustainable mobility in our city. And offer an attractive alternative to the car. By also using the water, the car can stay parked more often.”</p>
<h3><strong>Last mile</strong></h3>
<p>Initiators of Waterbus Delft are Kees Schonebaum and Tomas te Velde. “We are very pleased that we have a first in Delft with sustainable and innovative “last mile” passenger transport by water. This connects different neighborhoods along the Schie in Delft with each other and the center.”</p>
<p>The Waterbus Fifty is a new model for Alumax Boats that will be added to the series of Watertaxi 10, Watertaxi 20 and Watertaxi 30 models that have become known, among others, from Watertaxi Rotterdam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Extra production hall gives room for big ambitions</h4>
<p><strong>Meppel &#8211; Alumax Boats has more than doubled its company size by moving into a second production hall in Meppel harbor as of November 1. The substantial expansion gives the aluminum boat builders the space to further shape the growth that has begun.</strong></p>
<p>The second hall where Alumax Boats moves in has a floor area of about 950 m2 and is located directly on the water of the Meppel part of Port of Zwolle. In the new Alumax hall, very different models of aluminum hull boats are built; from sloops to tenders and from fireboats, workboats and luxury yachts to water cabs. The existing production hall with a production floor area of 700 m2 at Setheweg in Meppel, where Alumax Boats has been located since 2009, will be fully utilized as of November 1 for the technical finishing, furnishing and cladding of the aluminum boats.</p>
<p>Director Remko Germeraad, who together with Jarno Visscher owns Alumax Boats, is delighted with the expansion. &#8220;We had been looking for quite some time at the possibilities to expand,&#8221; says the Meppel boat builder. In doing so, all possible options were reviewed. &#8220;We had new construction plans but the current construction prices made that option quite risky.&#8221; Moving to a new location was also a possibility but Germeraad says that never materialized. &#8220;There is no more land available in the Meppel harbor area, so that was difficult.&#8221; Just when the entrepreneurs were thinking of looking beyond the borders of Meppel as well, the opportunity presented itself to move into the new Alumax hall. &#8221; When this hall turned out to be available we were able to do business quickly with the owner,&#8221; states a satisfied Germeraad.</p>
<p>The large expansion of capacity by moving into the second building offers Alumax Boats, according to the director, many more opportunities than it already had. To meet the increasing demand for Alumax boats from Europe but also beyond, the capacity at the Setheweg was not sufficient &#8220;We can now better meet the increasing demand for aluminum boats, where especially the demand for boats for the professional user is growing.&#8221; In addition, the good contacts Germeraad has in Vietnam are not doing the company any favors. &#8220;We delivered the first multi-purpose vessel in Vietnam early this year. Which can be deployed as a patrol/ambulance and-or firefighter and that has the necessary impact,&#8221; Germeraad says with a smile. The second order has just been secured and many more will follow. He expects more orders from the Asian country to follow in 2023 as well. &#8220;So we desperately need the new hall.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="tw-target-text" class="tw-data-text tw-text-large tw-ta" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Vertaling"><strong><span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">Hydrogen as an energy carrier can play a major role in the energy transition. However, its commercial application is still in its infancy. The investment costs of the drive system are still so high that profitable operation is not feasible. And then there is also the chicken-and-egg problem for the tank infrastructure: as long as there are no hydrogen vessels, the tank infrastructure remains limited and vice versa. Alumax Boats in Meppel is now tackling this problem. This is where the first hydrogen water taxi is being built for Watertaxi Rotterdam. In this aluminum water taxi, hydrogen is used to generate electricity to power the boat, making the range comparable to that of a diesel-powered ship. The hydrogen Watertaxi Rotterdam is being developed by the SWIM consortium, with financial support from the Municipality of Rotterdam, the Ministry of Infrastructure, the Gieskes-Strijdbis fund and Innovation Quarter. </span></strong></p>
<p class="tw-data-text tw-text-large tw-ta" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Vertaling"><span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">The SWIM consortium consists of Flying Fish, Zepp.solutions, Enviu and Watertaxi Rotterdam. In this collaboration, Zepp.solutions is responsible for the maritime hydrogen system, Watertaxi Rotterdam is responsible for the exploitation of the hydrogen Watertaxi and Enviu is the initiator, project leader and venture builder. Flying Fish has developed the innovative E-Drive system. The SWIM consortium has developed this innovative hydrogen-electric powertrain to accelerate the energy transition on water and give customers the opportunity to switch to a sustainable fuel without making operational concessions. </span></p>
<p class="tw-data-text tw-text-large tw-ta" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Vertaling"><span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">At the Alumax Boats yard, Alumax technicians are currently working closely with Flying Fish engineers. </span></p>
<p class="tw-data-text tw-text-large tw-ta" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Vertaling"><span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">For this E-drive, Flying Fish and their team of engineers have developed and built the high voltage distribution and safety system that distributes the power between the fuel cell system, the high voltage battery, the AC/DC charger, the DC/DC converter and the motor. In addition, the temperature management system, which cools all high-voltage components, was built by the people of Delft. But the low-voltage power and control system, including the Vessel Control Unit (VCU), the electrical switchboard and the power distribution to the powertrain components, was also designed by Flying Fish. </span></p>
<p class="tw-data-text tw-text-large tw-ta" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Vertaling"><span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">The next phase of construction will be the incorporation of the hydrogen fuel cell system. The maritime hydrogen system, developed by zepp.solutions, is a 45 kW all-in-1 module that contains all components necessary to generate electrical energy from hydrogen. In addition to the development and production of this module, zepp.solutions is also responsible for hydrogen storage. Divided over several tanks, the ship will soon be able to carry 14 kg of hydrogen, enough to sail around Rotterdam for a full day (about 9 hours).</span></p>

It will come as no surprise that the Corona pandemic has played an important role in this. Because the well-being of our people, and their loved ones, is always our top priority, we consider ourselves fortunate that the number of Corona infections in our company has been limited to an absolute minimum this year. However, that does not mean that we have not felt the effects of the pandemic. </span></strong></p>

<h4 class="tw-data-text tw-text-large tw-ta" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Vertaling"><span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">Corona </span></h4>
<p class="tw-data-text tw-text-large tw-ta" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Vertaling"><span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">Because like the rest of the world, we have also noticed that the pandemic had, and still has, a major impact on our daily work. As a result, already in 2020 as a result of factory closures, a raw materials crisis and in its wake a logistical crisis &#8211; also thanks to the &#8216;blocking ship&#8217; the Ever Given &#8211; . As a result, delivery times increased considerably, and in some cases congestion even meant that some items were no longer available at all. To top it off, the increased demand for our boats and the low supply on the (commodities) market also led to a torrent of price increases. From aluminum to motor and from wooden panels, stainless steel material to cushions; not one part of a boat had the same price at the end of 2021 as it was at the beginning of 2021. In the midst of this rollercoaster, we steadily built a record number of boats for our customers, which this year stretched from Paraguay to Vietnam and from Norway to found in Portugal. We owe them a lot of thanks for the unbridled patience they have had, and the understanding they showed, because although we felt the consequences of &#8216;Corona&#8217; on a daily basis, we have always been aware that as end users they suffered the most. of the various crises.</span></p>					</div>

Our order book was well filled, with the series of electric water taxis for Rotterdam and the Worker 41 for Vietnam being the most eye-catching. These kinds of large-scale projects have led us to expand our team this year with a number of specialists. After 27 years, Robert Boerma made the switch from Dutch Rescue Vehicles (DRV) to Alumax Boats and he is responsible for work preparation and engineering special products. Daan de Wit has strengthened our engineering team with his almost thirty years of experience in the boat sector. Finally, Gerjan Bosch is the latest addition to our team. Gerjan, like Robert and Daan, can boast of a rich career and is now leading the proverbial cart at Alumax Boats in our construction department, where he is a cooperating foreman. </span></p>
<p class="tw-data-text tw-text-large tw-ta" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Vertaling"><span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">We have not only provided our team with quality by expanding it, we have also seen our young talents take steps forward as a training company. Because despite the fact that Corona almost completely paralyzed education, Pim, Timo and Jeremy have again gained the necessary knowledge and experience. Together with the core group, which has been working in the same composition for years, the young talents and new colleagues form the foundation on which Alumax will continue to build in 2022.</span></p>					</div>

<p class="tw-data-text tw-text-large tw-ta" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Vertaling"><span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">It should be clear by now: we did not sit still in 2021 and that is because we have built more and larger boats. In addition to the aforementioned water taxis and the Worker 41, we have also delivered a whole range of sloops and tenders. Among other things, we see that the demand for electric boating is increasing, which is apparent from the fact that The Next, the sloop that we launched on the market in January 2020, is our leader this year when it comes to numbers. What we would also like to mention in this retrospective are the Bullit 660 fire-fighting boats that we built for the Fryslan Safety Region. We dare to say that we are specialists in that segment. </span></p>
<p class="tw-data-text tw-text-large tw-ta" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Vertaling"><span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">The large group of (international) customers who found their way to Alumax Boats in 2021 often first started their journey on the internet. And that didn&#8217;t just happen, it&#8217;s the result of the efforts that have been made to improve Alumax Boats&#8217; online visibility. The new website, which we launched at the beginning of this year, has played a major role in this. However, a functional website is of no use if you do not direct the &#8216;traffic&#8217; to it. And our social media channels play a decisive role in this. We are happy that all those channels have gained a larger fan base this year. </span></p>

And what we see is a year in which we are expected to experience many special moments. We hope to start building our extra hall, we will start building some special, challenging boats, we hope to further expand our team and we will bring new models to the market. But above all, we hope that 2022 will be the year in which we will beat Corona together. </span></p>

<p class="tw-data-text tw-text-large tw-ta" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Vertaling"><span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">Agnes Mulder, Member of Parliament on behalf of the CDA, paid a working visit to the Alumax Boats yard in Meppel on Friday, together with a delegation of local and provincial CDA politicians, where work is being carried out, among other things, on the construction of the well-known Rotterdam water taxis. Part of the visit also involved a cruise through the seaport of Meppel, which is part of the regional port company Port of Zwolle. The theme of the working visit was sustainability. Agnes Mulder was extensively informed at the Meppel aluminum boat builders about the construction of the seven <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/work-boats/aluminum-electric-watertaxi-30-xl/">emission-free water taxis</a> that Alumax has been building since last year on behalf of Watertaxi Rotterdam. Six of those seven boats will be fully electrically powered and the seventh water taxi will run on hydrogen. </span></p>
<p class="tw-data-text tw-text-large tw-ta" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Vertaling"><span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">The CDA delegation was told by director Remko Germeraad of Alumax Boats that not only <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/home-of-the-water-taxi/">the well-known water taxis</a> will soon be sailing emission-free. According to Germeraad, more and more consumers are also switching to an electrically powered <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/private-use/sloops/">sloop</a> or<a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/private-use/tenders-en/"> tender boat</a>. The Meppeler boat builder foresees that this electric boating trend will be taken over within a few years by the rise of hydrogen. “But then the developments in that area must be accelerated,” warned the Meppel boat builder. Germeraad sees that the pace in Germany is many times higher, especially when setting up infrastructure such as filling stations. “Perhaps it is all a bit more complex than it seems, but there are already hydrogen filling stations in Germany and there is plenty of testing with hydrogen, especially in the automotive industry. We as a boat builder nation in the world should do this with boat building. If we don&#8217;t, there is a chance that we will lose our leading position in the world.” Germeraad once again recalled that the same problem arose, and still does, with the advent of electric sailing. “In Amsterdam, electric sailing in the canals will be mandatory from 2025, but the infrastructure is not yet set up for it because there are hardly any charging points.”</span></p>
<p id="tw-target-text" class="tw-data-text tw-text-large tw-ta" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Vertaling"><span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">During the cruise through the Meppel harbor area, of course in an aluminum boat from Alumax, Agnes Mulder, Egbert Knorren (Meppel Municipality) and Klaas Neutel (Provincial Council) were informed about the developments in the ports of Port of Zwolle in the area of of sustainability. For example, the port authority, led by director Jeroen van den Ende, is fully committed to circularity, renewable energy, sustainable raw materials and climate adaptation. To this end, research is being carried out on behalf of the provinces of Overijssel and Drenthe, the municipalities of Meppel, Zwolle and Kampen and the Northern Innovation Lab Circular Economy into the opportunities and threats and the potential of sustainable port development in Port of Zwolle. </span></p>
<p class="tw-data-text tw-text-large tw-ta" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Vertaling"><span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">Agnes Mulder looked back on the visit with satisfaction afterwards. The Member of Parliament from Drenthe indicated that he was impressed by the company and promised to take the wishes of the Drenthe boat builders with regard to developments in the field of hydrogen to &#8216;The Hague&#8217;.</span></p>
