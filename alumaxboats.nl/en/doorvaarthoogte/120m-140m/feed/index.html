					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Bullit 720 outboard is an aluminium lightweight <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/what-is-a-tender-boat/">tender boat</a> of 2.3m wide and 7.20m long. The draft of the boat is 0.50m and the vertical clearance 1.25m. The hull weight of the Bullit 720 is 980 kilograms and the <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/design-categories/">design category</a> is C.</strong></p>
<p>The light aluminium tender is characterised by excellent sailing characteristics, stability and many possibilities due to space. <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-benefits-of-aluminum/">An advantage of aluminium boats</a> is that they are low-maintenance, they can be left in the water during the winter and if necessary they can freeze. Above all, aluminium is vandal-proof, it cannot be broken. This makes our boats resistant to vandalism. The Bullit 720 is multifunctional, that is why this aluminium boat is also used as a <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/multifunctional-aluminum-boats/">work boat</a> with various extras for the desired application. All Alumax boats have self-draining valves in the hull so that water can easily drain out of the boat. Very easy for <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/how-to-clean-an-aluminum-boat/">cleaning the boat!</a></p>
<h4>Why outboard?</h4>
<p>Unlike an inboard engine, the investment in an <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-outboard-engine/">outboard engine</a> is lower compared to the number of horsepower. Please note: if a boat goes faster than 20 km per hour, there is a license requirement. The Bullit 720 outboard offers luxury, convenience and sufficient speed to experience water pleasure in various forms. The Bullit 720 outboard is also very suitable for water sports.</p>
<h4>Are you Bullit proof?</h4>
<p>The Bullit range consists of 6 indestructible, self-bailing and maintenance-free <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/private-use/tenders-en/">tenders</a>. The aluminium boats are designed and built at our yard in Meppel and promote carefree boating pleasure. Available with<a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-inboard-engine/"> inboard diesel engine,</a> <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-outboard-engine/">outboard petrol engine</a> or an <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-advantages-of-an-electric-drive/">electric motor.</a> Because aluminium is much lighter than for example a comparable polyester sloop, they can also sail much faster. The Bullit series is designed for these speeds. They remain flat and above all stable sailing, so you do not have to stand up. Moreover, they are easy to trailer. Are you ready to cast off?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Alumax 500 Jon is a perfect flat-bottomed workboat that is especially suitable for shallow waters. The aluminum boat is 5m long and 2m wide. The draft is only 0.05m and the headroom is 1.20m. The hull weight is 420kg and the <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/ontwerpcategorien/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design category</a> is D.</strong></p>
<p>Water boards and nature managers therefore like to use this 'flat' boat with its blunt nose that makes it easy to get in and out of the boat. Thanks to its <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-benefits-of-aluminum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aluminum</a> hull, the Alumax Jon 500 is almost indestructible and low-maintenance. The entire boat is welded from 4 mm thick seawater-resistant aluminum. Please note that if a boat goes faster than 20 km per hour there is a boating <a href="https://www.cbr.nl/nl/recreatievaart-en-privevliegers/recreatievaart/recreatievaart-2/vaarbewijsplicht.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">license requirement</a>.</p>
