					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Bullit 600 E is an <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-benefits-of-aluminum/">aluminum lightweight</a> boat of 2.15m wide and 6.00m long. The Bullit 600 has a draft of 0.40m and a headroom of 1.15m. The hull weight is 600kg. The lightweight aluminum tender also has a remarkably shallow draft and is characterized by excellent sailing characteristics, stability and style. An advantage of aluminum boats is that they are low-maintenance, they can remain in the water during the winter and if necessary they can freeze. Above all, aluminum is vandal-proof, as it cannot be broken. This makes our boats resistant to vandalism. The Bullit 600 is multifunctional, which is why this indestructible aluminum boat - with the necessary modifications - is also used as a work boat. Think of inspection, fire fighting, patrol or enforcement boats.</strong></p>
<h4>Why electric?</h4>
<p>The choice for a durable electric motor is one<a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/ultimate-joy-with-an-electric-boat/"> for the future.</a> In some areas, you are now only allowed to sail electrically, which is why we offer most models electrically. The advantages of electric boating are, among other things, that it is more <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/taking-care-of-batteries/">maintenance-friendly,</a> quieter and it is usually a must for rental licences.</p>

<h4>Why inboard?</h4>
<p>In contrast to an outboard engine, the inboard engine is - as the name suggests - integrated in the boat. This is an advantage because boat and engine are one and are also seen as such. Another advantage is that vandalism has a smaller chance of succeeding. An inboard engine is more economical in fuel consumption, you can sail all day for just a few liters. The Bullit 660 inboard offers comfort, convenience and enough safety to sail on canals and turbulent waters. <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/de-voordelen-van-een-binnenboord-motor-inboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more</a> benefits of an inboard engine here.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Bullit 600 inboard is an<a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/the-benefits-of-aluminum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> aluminum</a> lightweight boat and offers boating fun for the whole family. The tender boat is 6.00m long and 2.15m wide. The draft is 0.40m and the headroom 1.12m. The hull weight is 621kg and the<a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/design-categories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> design category</a> is C.</strong></p>
<p>The lightweight aluminum tender is characterized by excellent sailing characteristics, stability and space. An advantage of aluminum boats is that they are low maintenance, they can remain in the water in winter and freeze if necessary. Above all, aluminum is foolproof, because it is not broken. This makes our boats resistant to vandalism. The Bullit 600 is multifunctional, which is why this indestructible aluminum boat - with the necessary modifications - is also used as a <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/workboats/workboat-600/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work boat</a>. Think of fireboats, patrol boats or enforcement boats.</p>
<p>All Alumax boats have self-draining valves in the hull so that water can easily drain out of the boat. Very handy for <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/en/how-to-clean-an-aluminum-boat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cleaning the boat</a>!</p>
<h4>Why inboard?</h4>
<p>In contrast to an outboard engine, the inboard engine is - as the name suggests - integrated in the boat. This is an advantage because boat and engine are one and are also seen as such. Another advantage is that vandalism has a smaller chance of succeeding. An inboard engine is more economical in fuel consumption, you can sail all day for just a few liters. The Bullit 660 inboard offers comfort, convenience and enough safety to sail on canals and turbulent waters. <a href="https://alumaxboats.nl/de-voordelen-van-een-binnenboord-motor-inboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more</a> benefits of an inboard engine here.</p>
