Part of the visit also involved a cruise through the seaport of Meppel, which is part of the regional port company Port of Zwolle. The theme of the working visit was sustainability. Agnes Mulder was extensively informed at the Meppel aluminum boat builders about the construction of the seven <a href=\"https:\/\/alumaxboats.nl\/en\/work-boats\/aluminum-electric-watertaxi-30-xl\/\">emission-free water taxis<\/a> that Alumax has been building since last year on behalf of Watertaxi Rotterdam. Six of those seven boats will be fully electrically powered and the seventh water taxi will run on hydrogen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"tw-data-text tw-text-large tw-ta\" dir=\"ltr\" data-placeholder=\"Vertaling\"><span class=\"Y2IQFc\" lang=\"en\">The CDA delegation was told by director Remko Germeraad of Alumax Boats that not only <a href=\"https:\/\/alumaxboats.nl\/en\/home-of-the-water-taxi\/\">the well-known water taxis<\/a> will soon be sailing emission-free. According to Germeraad, more and more consumers are also switching to an electrically powered <a href=\"https:\/\/alumaxboats.nl\/en\/private-use\/sloops\/\">sloop<\/a> or<a href=\"https:\/\/alumaxboats.nl\/en\/private-use\/tenders-en\/\"> tender boat<\/a>. The Meppeler boat builder foresees that this electric boating trend will be taken over within a few years by the rise of hydrogen. \u201cBut then the developments in that area must be accelerated,\u201d warned the Meppel boat builder. Germeraad sees that the pace in Germany is many times higher, especially when setting up infrastructure such as filling stations. \u201cPerhaps it is all a bit more complex than it seems, but there are already hydrogen filling stations in Germany and there is plenty of testing with hydrogen, especially in the automotive industry. We as a boat builder nation in the world should do this with boat building. If we don&#8217;t, there is a chance that we will lose our leading position in the world.\u201d Germeraad once again recalled that the same problem arose, and still does, with the advent of electric sailing. \u201cIn Amsterdam, electric sailing in the canals will be mandatory from 2025, but the infrastructure is not yet set up for it because there are hardly any charging points.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p id=\"tw-target-text\" class=\"tw-data-text tw-text-large tw-ta\" dir=\"ltr\" data-placeholder=\"Vertaling\"><span class=\"Y2IQFc\" lang=\"en\">During the cruise through the Meppel harbor area, of course in an aluminum boat from Alumax, Agnes Mulder, Egbert Knorren (Meppel Municipality) and Klaas Neutel (Provincial Council) were informed about the developments in the ports of Port of Zwolle in the area of of sustainability. For example, the port authority, led by director Jeroen van den Ende, is fully committed to circularity, renewable energy, sustainable raw materials and climate adaptation. To this end, research is being carried out on behalf of the provinces of Overijssel and Drenthe, the municipalities of Meppel, Zwolle and Kampen and the Northern Innovation Lab Circular Economy into the opportunities and threats and the potential of sustainable port development in Port of Zwolle. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"tw-data-text tw-text-large tw-ta\" dir=\"ltr\" data-placeholder=\"Vertaling\"><span class=\"Y2IQFc\" lang=\"en\">Agnes Mulder looked back on the visit with satisfaction afterwards. The Member of Parliament from Drenthe indicated that he was impressed by the company and promised to take the wishes of the Drenthe boat builders with regard to developments in the field of hydrogen to &#8216;The Hague&#8217;.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Member of Parliament Agnes Mulder (CDA) impressed by Meppeler boat builders.
